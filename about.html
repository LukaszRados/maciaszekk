    <p class="about__intro">Hi, my name is Konrad, currently working as Product Designer in healthcare industry. I focus on accessible solutions that help business grow and provides real value to the users who really need it. By education im a Graphic Designer, I have a keen eye on the typography and really enjoy crafting visuals, but all this is meaningless if what we are creating is not what people want to use - this took me to the place where i am today, where research and tests became my #1.</p>

  <div class="about__more">
    <p>I have finished Graphic Design education with Bachelor of Arts degree. During the study, I started working as a Brand Designer and continued it for next 4,5 years just to find out that my place belongs in products - crafting data driven, purposeful and user-centric experiences. Transitioning into Product Designer role in 2021 felt as a natural process of my journey - I was actively trying to search for possibilities to validate assumptions in ongoing branding projects for long time already, but it wasnâ€™t the right place for it. Since then, im constantly learning new things, pursuing business and product skills, on a mission to connect business and the users in the most effective way.</p>
