          <p class="text-2">Open Anesthesia is a knowledge-sharing platform that offers free educational resources for anesthesiologists and anesthesiology students. The objective was to redesign the outdated website to enhance its functionality, streamline its structure, boost user retention, and update its aesthetics to align with modern standards. I have led a brief discovery phase, which yielded much-needed insights for the whole team and provided the whole team with a better overview of the problems we're dealing with.</p>

        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">The desired outcome of our work was to increase visitor retention, allowing OA team to start building a community of contributors and readers. The existing website was clearly not supporting this goal, as it looked outdated, it’s structure was rather chaotic and not user-friendly. The core base of the portal are so called keywords, being articles on a given topic. There was already a huge database of keywords available for the visitors, sadly, linked as an external library which basically was a raw list of over a thousand of elements. To make things worse, search functionality that was there did not work as expected unless user provided exact phrase of the keyword (which in most cases is nearly impossible), forcing users to scroll through pages of the list, hoping to find desired article. Therefore, number one priority to assure portal truly serves as knowledge sharing platform was finding a way for the users to discover the content more easily.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">I was fortunate enough to be able to talk with few users being representatives of our target group (some of them already having previous experience with the portal). Sessions with users confirmed that biggest issues of current portal are related to poor content discoverability, contrast issues and unintuitive website architecture.</p>

        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Once the problem to solve was clear, I have embarked on the ideation and optimization process. Following user behavioral expectations i have led quick card sorting exercise for the client’s team to later radically simplify the website structure to enhance navigation, allow for content scalability and make content maintenance easier. Through collaborative workshops, it became evident that some subpages would no longer be supported, while others could be seamlessly merged into bigger units. These efforts extended to enhancing the learning experience. A pivotal change involved integrating the articles database into the website, allowing users to discover articles based on broader areas of interest, specific zones within selected areas, advancement levels, and more. This approach enabled visitors to browse the list and access valuable content in a similar way we would expect to look for a book in bookstore.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Subsequently, my focus shifted to retaining visitor engagement, effectively supporting their learning process, and offering additional value to encourage return visits. Recognizing the positive reception of the existing "Keyword of the day" section on the old homepage – a daily knowledge pill providing a condensed version of a full article – we decided to keep it and enhance its interactivity. The client's site team had been experimenting with a section called "Question of the day," featuring real-life scenario questions and single answer form. Given its alignment with project goals and time constraints, we decided to adapt and incorporate it alongside "Keyword of the day." Together, they formed a comprehensive and easy to access daily dose of knowledge, combining quick and interactive elements with in-depth information. Furthermore, a new section called "OA Series" was introduced, highlighting featured monthly video and audio materials from contributors. Combined with interactive section above, these features are offering exclusive daily and monthly learning materials.</p>
