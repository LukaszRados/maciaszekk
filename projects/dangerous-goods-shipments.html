          <p class="list-header">Intro:</p>
          <p class="text-2">We were faced with a challenge of creating a platform which would help major US research centers to centralize and streamline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods" target="_blank">Dangerous Goods Shipment</a> (including chemicals, research samples, explosive or radioactive materials) to and from other institutions. Product was to be created with direct cooperation of the most recognized Medical Universities based in United States that wanted to ensure all legal and regulatory rules are being followed during their shipments workflow, and at the same time contribute into setting new industry standards. Our key objective was to create a management panel that would be the hearth of the workflow, enabling all necessary actions to be executed on-site, increasing process efficiency. </p>

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">The project's onboarding revealed a huge challenge with processing of the extensive knowledge including domain-specific terms, definitions, and legal restrictions that required a thorough understanding. Shortly after the initial meeting the whole team began pursuing materials and any sources that would allow us understand industry standards and business requirements. Soon, it was clear that in the timeframe we had assigned for the discovery phrase, we could at best only scratch the surface of the required knowledge, missing opportunity to work with the users and address any of their insights on current workflow. Thanks to product stakeholders who had set us up for regular meetings with the University staff members, we could from now on rely on their domain expertise and gather only most relevant pieces of information - which made the whole process so much easier.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Our primary focus was to understand product use cases, roles in the process and the current workflow of the University staff members during Dangerous Goods shipments processing, which later could serve as a foundation for further exploration. We ran several workshop sessions with power users, collecting their thoughts and suggestions. To better understand the process of these individuals, we have done few remote observation sessions of their daily work routine, carefully spectating typical shipment processing flow. Of course, we took into account that our remote observation meant users were aware of being watched, likely leading to more careful behavior than in everyday practice. Yet, these sessions left us with tons of valuable insights on the current workflow and the problematic areas. Some of discovered pain points included actions that could be easily automated due to highly repetitive nature, areas with high human-error possibility, communication issues, high time pressure on staff members, prioritization issues and much more. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">We also had an opportunity to talk to the legal team and admins of the institution who play vital role during whole process of shipment approval. Their perspective on current workflow and wishes for the new product gave us few bright leads to explore, but also made us realize that we will need to carefully craft strong role permissions system due to variety of people involved in the process on different stages.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Crucial part of discovery process involved separating the actual core flow of the shipment processing from actions or areas that were institution-specific and might not allow for easy product adaptation by other institutions in the future. To accomplish this task, we compared the collected data with the practices of other universities and research centers, resulting in a trimmed down list of critical actions that had to happen in every shipment management process in order to succeed.</p>

        <h2>Optimization &amp; ideation</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">At this point, we had a solid understanding about the problems that the product we are creating needs to solve. By pinpointing identified pain points, with just a few tweaks of the existing workflow, we have been able to solve most of the discovered logical issues, eliminated dead ends in the workflow and prepared underground for product scalability, allowing for service integrations and making our solution an ultimate central-hub for shipment processing. Trying to stay flexible, the flow was build on modular basis, making it out-of-the-box possible for new institutions to customize it to their own needs.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Discovered communication issue grew to a scale where, although not in the MVP scope, it became a must-have on the list. Exisitng struggle was mainly caused by globally spread team with no official way of communication and different working hours, resulting in missed phone calls and lost e-mails. Possible solution was really simple, we could simply use widely known pattern of on-site commenting or chat, allowing to leave a message pinned to given shipment, tag people and set up notifications. The solution was warmly welcomed by the client and even got enriched by one significant upgrade, which was enabling users to be assigned to a shipment (as a person responsible for handling it) - this allows for easier direct contact with the right person. Assigning users also allowed us to consider creating personal dashboards for each user or even introducing workload management for admins in the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">One of the most important updates we worked on during this phrase was finding the best way to eliminate repetitive tasks employees needed to go through, often being the part of the process where most errors occur, mostly because of nature of this product, requiring superb precision when entering data into the system. Each shipment usually contains up to 10 items, where each of those has to be comprehensively documented - on average it took 4-5 minutes (of experienced staff member time) to add item to the shipment. This gives realistically 5 to 6 shipments processed maximum per working day, being not enough to process all requests smoothly, occasionally resulting in huge delays. </p>
          <p class="text-2">Looking for the solution, we have explored hundreds of cases and talked with the whole team of staff members, to validate our hypothesis that rearrangement of form fields in a way that the most repetitive ones would be entered only once per shipment, while specific item related fields would remain as they were, could be effective. We have also introduced feature of suggestions during form processing, allowing university employees to use data of items that were previously entered to any shipment in the past. This way, shipments that happens most often (or repeats once a while) will be able to be processed in just a few clicks.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping & Usability testing</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Despite our client expected development process to start straight away after approval of the discovery outcomes, we managed to show value in performing few user testing sessions before coding starts. Even though I was glad that we are following the right path of product design process, the whole pressure regarding creation of prototype, leading the usability tests and creating ready for handoff flows landed on me. Time was gold, so I decided to make most of it and went straight into hi-fidelity prototyping, making possible to not only test layout intuitiveness and interface feeling but also have almost ready material I could use for development handoff.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Starting with visually advanced prototypes brought also few drawbacks. One significant downside was the need to prepare design system base in advance, consuming some of already limited time we had. Another one was small room for UI adjustments due the first few screens had to be approved by the client before testing it with users. At this point it was much harder to make any layout-breaking changes as a result of the discovered usability or layout issues – this, however, could be avoided by modifying our internal workflow and/or paying more attention into educating our client, so we could have more freedom in testing various layout options with the users before allowing anyone to get attached to it - lesson to be learned. Luckily, because of general layout simplicity, it was possible to fix most problematic areas without too many visual changes.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">After having prototypes more-less ready for testing, we had to speed up with the user testing, being result of unexpected dev team availability and wishes for development to begin. This lead us to squeezing as much of the flow into the users testing sessions as possible, which sadly led to its ineffectiveness - users were getting tired, often focusing on non relevant areas, resulting in more overall effort required to gather user insights while keeping them on track all the time (and not BIASing them by mistake). Looking back at this situation, I think it’s definitely not worth testing as much as possible at once. We would surely get more valuable insights on the most critical parts if we did test only most important parts of the flow and left rest to be verified by quantitative data.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Despite these few struggles, everything came together nicely. After analysis, we were able to locate few common for most users issues as well as few suggestions for us to explore in the future. </p>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">End of user testing overlapped with the dev team being already onboarded to the project. Thanks to the work that was already done in previous step I could straight away share few first steps of the flow to the team. I could use my time to better organize figma board, fix missing components and make sure every piece is well described.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Together with the development team entering the project there was a new product owner replacing previous one, sadly whole process was done too quickly and with close to none knowledge sharing between them. From that moment until the final handoff, together with the backend lead who also participated in the discovery, we became an internal source of truth supporting the new PO and the team. As much as it was a rewarding experience, in some way, it slowed down the whole process as we were both busy with our own tasks and could not keep answering questions all the time. Fortunately, we successfully navigated through the early storm and at the end of the day achieved great results as a team.</p>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">This project presented a unique opportunity learn new things as it was rooted in highly specialized domain knowledge not readily available to the public. Discovery process was a great experience where we truly experienced discovering any part of information as a great victory. Challenge always sounds fun, but due to our understanding was constrained by the information the staff members chose to disclose, it occasionally led to unexpected shifts in our logic due to missing pieces of information. Nevertheless, we managed to overcome challenges and create solid tool for institutions.</p>
          <p class="text-2">As the Lead designer, this work stands out as a significant milestone in my career, being my inaugural experience in leading a project of such size. I am grateful for every brainstorming session I had pleasure to participate in with such great team.</p>
