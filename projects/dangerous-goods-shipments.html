      <p class="text-0">Our task was to create a platform that helps centralize and streamline the shipment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods" target="_blank">Dangerous Goods</a> (e.g. chemicals, research samples, explosives) to and from research institutions to ensure that all legal and regulatory rules are being followed. Product was designed for one of the most recognized Medical Universities based in United States. One of the key objectives was to build a product that would be universal and easy-to-adapt by other institutions for their own needs.</p>

    <div data-area="left">
      <p class="text-2">Project onboarding threshold was really high, there were tons of details, domain terms, definitions, law restrictions and regulations that needed to be well understood to deliver valuable product. One of the things we learned shortly after first meeting was that there is no possibility that we can get familiar in given timeframes with required knowledge and it will be necessary to rely on client-side staff members expertise.</p>
      <p class="text-2">The main objective of the discovery phase was to learn how our Client currently processes shipments with Dangerous Goods, so we could use it as a starting point. A crucial part of this task was to separate the universal/core shipment processing flow from areas that were suitable only for this Client and might not be as useful for other organizations in the future. Confirming the core flow required wider exploration with other universities and research centers who had their own "best practices". Having different perspectives allowed us to define the core path.</p>
      <p class="text-2">Once the above was clear, we could focus on addressing pain points in the current workflow and search for opportunities that could help users work more effectively. In order to achieve our goals we ran extensive workshop sessions with users, combined with observations of their daily work routine (I am aware that because those observations were done remotely, so with full user awareness of being observed, things we experienced are likely the “perfect” version of how it’s usually done, but it still provided us with a tons of new insights).</p>
      <p class="text-2">We have also paid attention to the business strategy which was already there, but required just a little help with defining it and setting a clear North Star that would lead us through development stages.</p>

    <h2 data-area="header">Optimization & Ideation</h2>
    <div data-area="left">
      <p class="text-2">At this point we had plenty of insights we could use to make the workflow more suitable for user needs. We could clearly see a huge demand for solutions that would make employees life easier and make working hours more productive. Some of the discovered pain points were common for this type of workflow and included communication issues, documentation storage, staff workload management and human factor errors.</p>
      <p class="text-2">Optimization started with remapping of the core workflow to make whole process more intuitive and allow users to complete daily tasks faster with less possible mistakes. We have cut the flow into main blocks which allowed to have better visibility on where it is possible to put some customized elements for any future institution using this product. Next, we focused on generating solutions and suggestions answering the discovered pain points and needs.</p>
      <p class="text-2">This phrase was ended with ~8 hours workshops (divided for few days) where together with super users and stakeholders we were carefully going through the final flow and new features plans.</p>
