          <p class="list-header">Intro:</p>
          <p class="text-2">Me and my colleagues were faced with a challenge to create a platform that would help to centralize and streamline the shipment of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods" target="_blank">Dangerous Goods</a> (e.g. chemicals, research samples, explosives) to and from research institutions. Product was being created with cooperation of one of the most recognized Medical Universities based in United States that wanted to ensure that all legal and regulatory rules are being followed during their shipments workflow, but also wanted to optimize industry performance. Our key objective was to build a product that would be the hearth of the workflow, enabling all necessary actions to be executed on-site and be easy to customize by other institutions for their own needs.</p>

        <hr>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left" style="max-width: 450px;">
          <p class="text-2" >The project's onboarding revealed a huge challenge lying ahead â€“ the extensive details, domain-specific terms, definitions, and legal restrictions that required a thorough understanding for successful product delivery.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Shortly after the initial meeting, it was clear that the timeframes we had wouldn't allow us to even get close to the necessary expertise independently. Because of this, we organized our work in a way that allowed for strong cooperation between us and the experienced client-side staff members, allowing us to verify our assumptions within given areas with almost no delay.</p>
          <p class="text-2">During the discovery phase, our primary goal was to understand our client's use cases and the current approach to handling shipments involving Dangerous Goods, which later could serve as a foundation for further exploration. A crucial part of this task involved separating the universal core flow of the shipment processing from areas that were client-specific and might not be as useful for other organizations in the future. To accomplish this task, we had to compare the collected information with the practices of other universities and research centers. As a result of this research, we ended up with a list of actions that had to happen in every shipment management process - this way, the delivery team knew where the core flow ends and personalization begins.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle2" style="max-width: 450px;">
          <p class="text-2">Next, we focused on addressing pain points within the core workflow and searching for opportunities that could help users work more effectively. We ran several workshop sessions with power users, collecting their thoughts and suggestions. To better understand the process, we have also done remote observations of their daily work routine, which left us with tons of insights on the current workflow and the problematic areas - this included steps that could be easily automated, areas that were unpleasant for the user, areas with high human-error possibility, communication issues, and much more. We also had an opportunity to talk to the legal team about their perspective and wishes for the product as their input plays a vital role in shipments approval.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Coming close to the end of the discovery phase, we could see a huge demand for solutions that could optimize employees' work. Some of the discovered pain points were pretty common for this type of workflow and included communication issues, repetitive tasks, human factor errors, shipment approval issues, documentation storage, and staff tasks/workload management.
            During research, I paid extra attention to make sure everything was well documented and organized, so we could get back to the collected information at any time (in the end, this effort paid off).</p>

        <div data-area="left" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2" >At this point, we had a solid understanding of where we were and which direction we should take. To ensure a seamless start, we focused on the optimization of the product flow map we had created earlier. By pinpointing and addressing identified pain points with a few tweaks, we resolved the most logical issues and eliminated dead ends in the workflow. With those improvements in place, we turned our attention to customer-specific personalization, emphasizing future ease of maintenance.</p>
          </div>
        <div data-area="middle2" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2">Next, we looked for solutions to solve the remaining discovered issues. To achieve the best possible outcomes, we have been using the opportunity solution tree model. In brainstorming sessions where every team member was aware of the desired outcome and opportunities, we generated numerous ideas that were later validated, resulting in just a few realistic solutions that showed promise.</p>
          <p class="text-2">This phase ended with approximately six hours of workshops over two days, where, together with University staff members and stakeholders, we carefully went through the optimized product flow and suggested new solutions.</p>

        <p class="text-2" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">PROTOTYPE & USABILITY TESTING</p>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2" >Due to high time pressure and the need to lead a few usability testing sessions before handoff to the delivery team, prototypes were being created in mid-fidelity quality, making it possible to test not only layout intuitiveness but also interface feeling and readability.</p>
          <p class="text-2" >Going mid-fidelity brought many positive aspects to the design process, like huge time optimization, but there were also a few drawbacks, and some of them were our own fault. One significant downside was the limited room for UI adjustments after the first few screens were approved by the client before testing with users. From there it was much harder to make any layout-breaking changes as a result of the discovered usability crash â€“ this however could be avoided by modifying our internal workflow, so we could have more freedom in testing various layout options with the users before presenting it to the client. Luckily, because of general layout simplicity, I was able to fix most problematic areas without too many changes to the approved version, but still, it was unnecessarily harder and took more time than it should have. </p>
          </div>
        <div data-area="middle2" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2">Another problematic area was revealed during user testing when some users had a hard time focusing on anything else than the imperfect visual layer â€“ those were not hi-fidelity mockups yet, but at the same time not low-fidelity ones anymore, leaving users wondering if this is really how it should look like. I have been trying to expand the introduction with a more careful explanation of the tasks and informing at what stage the prototypes currently are, yet it still didnâ€™t work in most cases. This experience left me feeling that more refined (or raw) prototypes would allow our users to better focus on their tasks, so we could reach better insights.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Despite the downsides, I believe that starting with mid-fidelity wireframes was worth it. Keeping in mind how users behave during testing I could take their responses with a pinch of salt and focus on the issues that were common for the whole group or did not involve interface appearance at all.</p>

        <div data-area="left" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2" >Crafting the final designs was pretty straightforward thanks to the work I already did in the previous step. My role primarily involved working with the components, including white labeling and compiling a comprehensive guidelines document for the team to follow.</p>

        <div data-area="middle2" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2">The journey towards the ultimate designs was accompanied by delivery team onboarding and sudden product owner replacement (with minimal knowledge transfer). From this moment until the handoff, together with the Backend lead, we became an internal source of truth supporting the new PO and the team â€“ as much as it was a rewarding experience, in some way, it slowed down the whole team as we were both dealing with our tasks. Fortunately, we successfully navigated through the entire process and achieved great results. Well done, team!</p>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2" >This project presented a unique opportunity for us as it was rooted in highly specialized domain knowledge not readily available to the public. We leaned heavily on the expertise of seasoned professionals from universities and research centers, who generously shared invaluable insights into the field. While our understanding was constrained by the information the staff members chose to disclose, it occasionally led to unexpected shifts in our logic due to missing pieces of information. Nevertheless, our strong discovery phase helped in addressing many of our initial questions, providing a solid foundation for the entire project.</p>
          </div>
        <div data-area="middle2" style="max-width: 390px;">
          <p class="text-2">As the Lead UX/UI Designer, this project stands out as a significant milestone in my career, as it marks my inaugural experience in leading a project of such size. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with the Stakeholders and Administrative Staff from Research centers. Once the product was going live, we armed it with analytics tools and left stakeholders with a continuous discovery mindset, making sure the product adapts to evolving user needs.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Reflecting on this journey, from the initial discovery phase to the final product launch, it was a great learning experience, and I am proud of the work we accomplished together.</p>
          <p class="text-2" style="font-style: italic;">Update (12.2023) - Product stakeholders reached out to us to enter the post MVP phrase! due to my full engagement in other projects, I'm acting as a part-time consultant supporting a new team.</p>
