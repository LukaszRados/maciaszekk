          <p class="text-2">The personal website created for my close friend Łukasz is one of the projects I enjoy going back to. Even now, after a few years of its existence, it still looks fresh. The main objective was to create a place where Łukasz could share his photographies from all around the world and share blog posts about his adventures. However, it was not meant to be just another photography website, there was a need for something extraordinary.</p>

        <h2>Defining the goal</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Starting off, we worked together with Łukasz and went through a quick workshop session to gather his expectations. The general objective was simple: presenting photography albums grouped by the countries where the pictures were taken. The tricky part was making it look and feel different than many other portfolios out there using the same concept.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Our aim went beyond simply displaying Łukasz's photos; we wanted them to reach out and captivate the viewers, leaving a lasting imprint in their memory. So the challenge was to craft a special and engaging experience for everyone who landed on the portfolio page, making images unforgettable moments, and praising each shot and effort that was made to capture it.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">It’s also about traveling, and exploring the unknown – Łukasz wanted to share blog posts describing his adventures while traveling and photographing places. If we could find a solution to combine those two aspects into one, we would create a place that not only presents an individual viewing perspective of the surrounding world but also shares stories about those places, reveals the backstage, and invites the visitor to experience that journey.</p>

        <h2>Research &amp; ideation</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Having the goal set, I began research on how other photographers showcase their work. I have scrolled through dozens of albums, searching for common patterns, discovering both great and not-so-great solutions and layouts. During research I have also focused on reviewing bunch of printed photography albums, which are (and hopefully always will be) never dying classic, providing supreme experience.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Indisputably the advantage of classic photo albums over digital ones lies in possibility to hold / feel physical print in own hands. It’s also the awareness that each print brings many hours of careful author selection and postproduction on the backstage, which is a much more challenging task compared to creating a digital album (once it’s printed, it cannot be changed). Furthermore, the experience could be compared to a revealing journey, you cannot see the whole gallery on a single page; you usually first go through the title page, then the cover image (most often the author’s top choice, best fit to the category) and then the rest of the photos one by one. This kind of journey makes this experience unique, every shot gets its time to shine (unlike digital albums, where viewers’ focus span drastically peaks down nowadays, causing fast-scrolling, resulting in most pieces of the gallery being skipped); this hypothesis can be partially confirmed with <a href="https://riseaboveresearch.com/photo-printing-remains-an-integral-part-of-consumers-lives-according-to-a-new-rise-above-research-study/" target="_blank">Rise Above Research’s study</a> on printing photographies, confirming that even nowadays, most people in various ages believes “prints are the best way to view important photos”.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Knowing that printed albums rank high on the podium, what could we do to make our digital experience equally valuable? It’s obvious that we are losing the aspect of physical contact with the pictures, but we still can somehow mimic printed album flow.</p>
          <p class="text-2">So what if we try to not spoil the album content to the user too early? What if we would use only the titles of the sections before presenting any images? This way we could potentially build the atmosphere of the unknown, similar to when we take a printed album from the bookshelf, and encourage visitors to explore the content. This, however, can be also dangerous, will users be curious enough? Or will just give up and leave? There were many more questions to be asked, but due to project size and the fact it’s a personal experimental page, it seemed not worth it to lose time on digging any deeper and validating it with users at this stage - we were not risking anything and could adjust live.</p>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Creating first flows and layout sketches allowed us to get a better overview of the user journey. We quickly found out that we should not stick to the printed album experience too closely. We had to drop the one by one photo browsing because each album was meant to be 20+ photos, therefore we had to allow for easier gallery browsing to not lose viewers’ attention halfway through.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">The minimalistic approach of the main page described in the previous step revealed a few issues with managing visitor engagement. Within our closest group of people, we have tested various ways of keeping users engaged, including page interactiveness, visual effects, and also displaying cover photos upfront.</p>

        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">The final layout was selected based on two criteria: level of innovativeness / uniqueness (based on tested audience responses) and duration of users captivation before switching to quick auto-navigating mode.</p>

          <p class="text-2">Version visible below was a clear winner in both areas (followed by 3 column gallery grid). It’s build of highly interactive home page, which even though is less great when it comes to web accessibility standards and assistive technology support, offered most entertaining and engaging experience, and this is exactly what we were looking for.</p>
