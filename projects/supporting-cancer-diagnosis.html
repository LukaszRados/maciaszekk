          <p class="text-2">Being diagnosed with a cancer is a horrifying moment for everyone, it’s overwhelming and leaves impression of hopelessness, especially when the best care and treatment plans are not affordable. We were asked to help making the journey of diagnosed patients easier, more accessible and encouraging. The product would be dedicated to employees as a work benefit with high employee privacy and no hidden costs. Knowing that cancer patients often struggle with every-day activities, it was crucial for us to make sure navigating portal leaves no room for usability issues.</p>

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Shortly after being invited to the project we began looking for information on how do the diagnosed patients seek for support and what motivates them to take action, so we could potentially use that knowledge and transform it into meaningful experience. Materials we had were pretty wast and successfully allowed us to get a solid groundwork done and reveal remaining gray areas to explore. One of the biggest unknowns was the current workflow of our client, which revealed how complex the whole system is, including many different disconnected roles that needs to be involved on different stages in order to provide the final value (being second opinion on the treatment plan) to the patient. Due to business requirements and time constraints, we focused mainly on the patients and the doctors with their medical units where patients were diagnosed, leaving rest of the process to the clients employees leading it on the backstage.</p>
          <p class="text-2">To better understand behavioral profile of our users, we went through few studies revealing difficulties that oncology patients struggle with the most, which are vision and focus impairments, cognitive difficulties, depression, social isolation. It became clear that due to physical limitations of our users, we need to pay special attention to overall web accessibility standards to an extent that it would be possible for most of the users, especially those using assistive technology, to easily navigate the platform and receive the support. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">On the other side of the spectrum there is a doctor, being the primary treating oncologist of the patient, having all of the necessary data about patient treatment history. Although most of the cases does not require contacting treating oncologist before processing, there are situations where extra support is required, then contact request is sent. We have investigated how does the current way of contact with the doctors works, and it clearly required few improvements as it was the most critical part of the flow that often terminated the whole process. With support of client’s operations team we have successfully addressed the pain points of the process and worked through few possibilities for improvement to validate. We have also prepared ourselves for a situation when there is no possibility to contact the doctor directly and it needs to be done vie unit front desk. In that case, we have to be sure that the request was forwarded from the front desk staff to the doctor. We have found out that historical front desk contact attempts were not tracked at all, so the team did not know if the message reached the doctor or was ignored by the front desk, so perhaps this improving this area will enable us to boost overall conversion of the requests.</p>

        <h2>prototypes &amp; user interviews</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Being aware of the challenges our users (patients) are going through, we have started prototyping v1 layout of the landing page, registration flow and the home page of the portal with the simplicity set as a top priority. The last thing we would want is to force the fatigued users to struggle with over-designed pages - thats why we tried to stay as simple and used as many widely known layout patterns as only possible - it was not our selling point to look unique. We have paid extra attention to the content design, making sure the overall feeling of going through the page is building feeling of support and care, but most importantly also gives hope that there is always a chance for things to go back to normal. To achieve that, we have cooperated with native copywriter who supported us with the messaging. We have also paid special attention to the colors and imagery, which had to be serious yet optimistic and up-lifting. </p>
          <p class="text-2">Simultaneously to first prototypes of the interface being prepared, we focused on creating bulletproof design system which would serve not only as a foundation for both patient and doctor facing interfaces, but also as an solution easy to maintain and use by less experienced designers on the client side after our work is done. Most of the components were build on a headless system basis, allowing for huge flexibility, time optimization and project file memory management. This is also the first time when we have gave up on creating classic color styles and entirely switched to variables, allowing for smooth implementation of dark mode and easier handoff to the dev team - all of the variable names were semantic and possible to be exported directly to CSS code, enabling dev team to get to the start line much faster.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Crucial part of this phase was connecting with actual oncology patients, being workers of a big companies around US, and performing few moderated tests on the prototypes we had. We began preparation of the artifacts for the testing sessions, carefully defining scope of test, our goals, expected results, uncertain areas and the screener which we would use during recruitment to make sure we are talking with the right people. Thanks to the comfortable situation we were in (2 designers in one project) we have split our responsibilities during the test to get the most of it. It was on me to lead the conversation with the participants, while other designer spectated and noted patient behavior and actions as well as own observations.</p>
          <p class="text-2">During the test, we have been paying extra attention to the overall perception of the website, including tone of voice, imagery, emotions, service value as well as content understanding, information architecture (including section orders) and any thoughts that came during the conversation. It was extremely important to stay neutral when speaking with the participants to not influence their behavior or just unintentionally harm them by asking the wrong question - some of them were already deep into the chemotherapy or just diagnosed, often having mood swings (which is completely understandable, but could heavily affect test results). After finalizing the first testing session (close to 20 interviews) we began analysis on the gathered information which gave us tons of insights. We have grouped the outcomes of the interviews and together with the client prioritized them to later fix the most crucial issues - most of them were related directly to content design and sections rearrangement. </p>
          <p class="text-2">We decided to continue the same process for next part of our work, which required completing entire platform prototype first and then again prepare for next interview sessions to validate it. This time we decided to limit the number of participants to 10, still being more than enough to get best results (most of the time 5 people are enough to get most of the discoverable patterns, which also was true in our case). After adjusting few minor usability issues the patient facing platform was ready to be implemented.</p>

        <h2>Doctor role</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Role of the doctor, being primary treating oncologist of the patient, is usually limited to being contacted at the last stage of the process when the patient case has been already reviewed by external specialists and their second opinion is documented, our client’s specialists then reaches the doctor and discusses the best treatment plan for the patient. There are however cases where doctor or doctor’s front desk support is required in order to start the review process due to some missing patient details. In that case medical records request is sent to the unit font desk and then waiting for response begins.</p>
          <p class="text-2">The whole flow struggled with few issues, first critical one was the risk of PHI leakage, as till this day most of the medical documentation is sent via FAX in the US, being seen a one of the HIPAA compliant ways of information transferring. However, reality shows that this method should no longer be used and it would be much safer to switch to modern authentication methods. There is also aspect of FAX message being not possible to be tracked, resulting in no information if the receiver has seen the message, which requires additional effort with phone calling - which is not always possible due to various reasons. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Due to importance of contact between our client’s staff and the medical units, we worked on finding optimal solutions to overcome known issues. The most difficult part of this task was finding balance between HIPAA regulations and ease of the unit staff accessing the request/patient report which was crucial - everyone is busy, requiring high effort process in this situation most certainly would equal to no conversion. Thanks to the support of associated Oncology doctor we were able to seek for advice on possible solutions and better understand how doctors/units usually react to this kind of FAX messages. </p>
          <p class="text-2">As a result, we have created a hybrid solution; for medical records request we would allow front desk staff to access the request via private link and if possible transfer required documents to encrypted storage, without the need to register or authenticate. This allowed the process to be as lightweight as possible while still remaining secure as there were no PHI displayed. In case of passing the ready patient report there is a need for doctor authentication to preview patient details. In that case we would send an information to the front desk, similarly to how it was previously done, with the difference that we are sending just a link to the portal. Once doctor sees it, it would be possible to register with personal number and after successful verification the report would be accessible on the dashboard. The doctors account remains active, so any other report for different patients could be accessed much faster. </p>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">The client presented great product and business awareness throughout whole design process, also when the work was coming close to the end, I was asked to set up the analytics basis allowing to gather all valuable information on the user behavior. I have started this process with researching analytic tools that would be compliant with HIPAA regulations and would not require too much effort from the dev team to install. Final choose was MixPanel with a paid plan, luckily being a tool that I already knew, so i could support our internal team with the setup and also instruct client how to use it.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Then I have prepared a board with noted down business requirements and prepared list of metrics supporting it, which also required preparing full list of events that had to be tracked within the system.</p>

          <p class="text-2">Im glad we could use our knowledge to support project with such mission. Thanks to client product awareness and willingness to create best possible solution, we were able to lead one of biggest moderated interviews sessions I have ever participated in, being a great opportunity to level up my interviewing skills. </p>
          <p class="text-2">Currently product is live and there are first companies with big names signing in. Hoping to see this product going strong in the future!</p>
