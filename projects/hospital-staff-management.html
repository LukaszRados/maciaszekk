          <p class="list-header">Intro:</p>
          <p class="text-2">Managing nurses schedules in hospitals (both in US and here in Poland) currently looks exactly the same as 20 years ago - you print out schedule grid with the names of nurses, manually fill out the shifts one by one making sure each shift is equally staffed and then hand it over to the nurses. And you repeat it every 3 to 4 weeks. It is a horrendous experience, extremely time consuming, hard to maintain and nearly impossible to include working days preferences of individual nurses, which eventually leads to nurses dissatisfaction, burnout or job leaving. Personally, one of my family members works as a nurse, so I exactly knew that the struggle is real, and just couldn’t want more to roll up my sleeves and help our client with the revolution that is coming.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Project stakeholders came to us already prepared with a insights from a great discovery led by themselves. We exactly knew what the problem to solve was, what were the personas we were targeting, what were the use cases and what potential opportunities/risks they managed to discover.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Knowing all of the necessary details, we were asked to prepare absolute core flow prototype that would allow running few market fit tests before moving forwards with full product design. The client already had some vision and sketches how the process could work but it required our refinement - especially when it comes to defining how user’s interaction with the product should look like. Even though we were covering only the core product flow just to showcase general idea, there was a lot to be done - there are completely separate flows for the nurses and the staff managers, with different tasks to be done. Because time was a top priority at that stage, i have asked fellow designer to join me so we could work on both flows simultaneously. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">In just 2 weeks, constantly validating our solutions with the development team, we have created a functional raw bone prototype of the product, prioritizing quick & simple actions and general look and feel of the interface - which is one of main factors that in most cases sells the product and catches investors and hospitals management boards attention (which is exactly what we wanted to achieve). And so was it in our case, after few weeks, the stakeholders came back with a great feedback from potential hospitals that were interested in joining the program. This way we got a green light for the next project phrases and breaking down the big idea client had into the realistic and functional pieces. </p>
          <p class="text-2">Designing of the product had to be done with keeping in mind both personas at all times. However for sake of this case study I will split nurse and staff manager perspectives into separate sections.</p>

        <h2>The nurse experience</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Starting off with product’s main actors, the nurses, everyday patient-facing heroes, it was crucial for product success to accurately define what problems are the most important to solve. The goal is to increase nurse work satisfaction and minimize risk of burning out... generalizing, it is often caused by issues on nurse-manager line while setting up work schedule that respects nurse work days preferences and/or planned days off. Other common issues that can be easily found while reading through almost any industry blog regards understaffed shifts or shifts with too many unexperienced nurses, forcing experienced nurses to work harder than acceptable. Of course there are a lot of other issues to be fixed, but some of them are health system issues that cannot be fixed with a tool. </p>
          <p class="text-2">There are already few existing solutions on the market allowing nurses scheduling time off or preview shift coworkers, none of them however truly focuses on nurse shift preferences or overall fairness of the assignments. By simply providing nurses with a tool to provide their shift preferences and planned days off in advance, we might open ourselves to limitless possibilities of managing schedule fairness, level of preferences honored and possibility to expand further on analytics, shift staffing, team communication and many more. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">Creating final solution required us to validate our assumptions with the actual nursing staff, which luckily was easy to arrange due to great cooperation with stakeholders who had some ready connections we could use. Our final approach included creating custom flow of pre-scheduling, which allows nurses to assign shift or non-shift days accordingly to own needs and share it on unit level in advance. Tool offers also features which makes it useful on a daily basis, even though it’s primary role is to be used once/twice per scheduling period.</p>
          <p class="text-2">I have paid extra efforts to assure that the nurse flow is as simple and intuitive as only possible due to wide range of age of our target group, where not every nurse might be technologically fluent yet. Additionally, tests revealed that the most experienced nurses will likely be very skeptical at the product’s early stage due to old habits and/or conservative approach. Because of this, we had to assure that product usage learning process is as short and as time-efficient as only possible, allowing for easy user adaptation. As easy as it seems, it took quite a lot of effort to sail away from some of the ideas Stakeholders had, argumenting low to no value added or unnecessary flow complexity increase. </p>

        <h2>The Staff manager experience</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="project__columns">
        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">While nurse preferences are being collected, behind the scene there is a powerful logistic center in the hands of the staff manager, monitoring all data live-time. Once all nurses share their preferences (or new schedule is just a few days ahead), administrative work begins, being the critical point of the whole product flow, where new schedules are composed accordingly to nurse requests. As mentioned earlier, this is where the traditional old-school flow struggles the most. To assure scheduling process is smooth and no nurse feels skipped ever again, staff manager panel has been armed with set of tools, markers and metrics allowing for precise operations. </p>
          <p class="text-2">It is wrong to expect that preferences of the nurses, grouped together, will create a ready-to-go schedule. Every week has to be equally staffed, and it is expected that most people does not want to work late Fridays, weekends or during holiday. This leads to situation where some nurse preferences needs to be changed to assure Unit operability. To ensure any changes made to these individuals are still done fairly compared to other workers, we have introduced fairness scores, being overall preference respecting indicator, allowing managers to adjust shifts and use this data to manage nurse satisfaction (both short and long term).</p>
          <p class="text-2">Fairness-related challenge also applies to experienced and less-experienced nurses on shift ratio. This, however, strongly depends on hospital / unit and staff that is available. This led us to creating list of adjustable markers for each unit, so the staff manager has the possibility to adjust the tool to own needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-area="middle1">
          <p class="text-2">We were fortunate enough to be able to cooperate closely with two staff managers and confront suggested solutions. Those sessions allowed us to truly get full picture of both ends of the process (nurse/manager) which also reflected on a few changes in the nurse flow.</p>
          <p class="text-2">Even though whole system is quite complex and uses a lot of calculations on the backend, one of biggest challenges here was making user interface readable. Manager deals with tons of different information that needs to be visible at all times to assure every nurse is treated equally well, including all of their contracted working days being used, assuring no gaps in the whole schedule, making sure there is always a charge nurse assigned, etc... You can imagine it’s a lot, and here similarly to nurse persona, age range of staff managers is wide, but most often those are rather more experienced individuals, with lower technical fluency and possibly less willingness and patience to struggle with a completely new solution. Taking above into account, it was crucial to reduce cognitive load of the whole interface as much as possible, while not loosing any of the value at the same time. As a result, every possibility to maximize screen usage was used, including collapsable elements, object hiding, descriptive icons and much more, being a middle ground between fully informative and readable. To minimize learning process, the scheduling layout mimics classic printed out schedule, presenting already pre-filled grid with validations, fairness scores and shift details. Tests revealed that allowing drag&drop interaction unlocks huge potential for ease of schedule adjustments and also user adaptation, so even though it added some work to the scope, it was worth going for it.</p>

        <div data-area="left">
          <p class="text-2">Both flows had their own unique challenges to overcome. The fact that the time we had to create ready product was relatively short makes this project one of the most dynamic and exciting ones I had pleasure to work on so far. The end result is a functional tool, that is already being used by few big units around US and is continued to be developed by it’s own internal team. I’m really happy with the outcome we reached as a team - huge applause to everyone involved (if any of you ever reads this).</p>
